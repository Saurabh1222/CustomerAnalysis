# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI to understand purchasing patterns, customer segments, and business insights.

The goal is to convert raw transactional data into meaningful insights that help businesses improve marketing, product placement, and sales strategies.

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses collect a lot of purchase data but often struggle to understand:

- Who are the most valuable customers?
- What products sell together?
- How purchasing behavior varies across demographics
- Which segments generate maximum revenue

This project performs end-to-end analysis from raw data → cleaning → exploration → visualization → business insights.
